 <h2>Who am I?</h2>
 
    <p>I'm a young lad who's working hard to learn html in order to create the best web site for his own business and in order to accomplish this his creating a series of web pages that feature all the knowledge aquired along the way.</p>
    <p>Moreover, this work is not only about HTML, but also CSS, JavaScript, and Python. In other words, this page represents the synthesis of my journey through the programming "realm", with the goal of becoming as proficient as possible in programming.</p>

 <h2>What am I learning?</h2>

 <h3>HTML</h3>
    
    <p>To learn HTML I didn't bought a course to follow. I am learning everything I need from Youtube (there is a great content in there), I'm meaning... I'm watching video of 4 hours or more to learn the basics - <em>the basics!</em>. <br> Currently I'm watching this video: "Learn HTML / Full Tutorial for Beginners (2022)". but I have a list of the videos I'll be watching in order to become good at HTML.
    </p>
    <p>Here:
        <dl>
            <dt>
            <dd>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE&t=2987s">Learn HTML / Full Tutorial for Beginners (2022)</a></dd>

            </dt>
        </dl>
