				<p class="container">Despite the title of this website, I'm not teaching CSS. Instead, I'm sharing what I'm learning about CSS with all of you. My intention is to create a portfolio for myself, and who knows, maybe I'll share it with someone and land a job. In any case, I want to maintain a sort of diary to track my learning progress, and I hope you all can provide tips on how to work with CSS more effectively.
		
			<div class="circle"><h2>What am I basing this on?</h2></div>

				<p class="container">I'm not attending any kind on class on CSS, I'm simply watching a youtube video about it and put everything I'm learning in practice. However I'll start exploring GitHub more often to get tips, learn new stuff and get to know other people's projects to inspire my own.</p>  

			<div class="circle"><h2>What is my goal with this project?</h2></div>

				<p class="container">I wanna become a good web desinger and once I finish this course keep improving my knowlegde and skills. Develop my own website will certainly be real achivement!</p>
